= Threshold cross-chain - Sui

This package brings Bitcoin to Sui blockchain through Wormhole integration. For more details please

```

- `BTCDepositorWormhole` is the L1 (Ethereum) contract that initiates tBTC bridging to Sui
- `Wormhole TokenBridge` (on both chains) handles the cross-chain message passing and token transfers
- `BitcoinDepositor` is a Move module on Sui that receives Wormhole messages and coordinates the deposit flow
- `SuiWormholeGateway` is a Move module that manages the minting/burning of tBTC tokens
- `tBTC` is the native tBTC token implementation on Sui (Move module)

=== Updating Wormhole Gateway mapping

The deployment scripts are responsible for managing updates of the tBTC gateway
addresses across various chains. These addresses are stored in the `external/`
directory for a specific network.
It is important to note that these addresses should remain constant for the 
mainnet network. However, there may be instances where a new version of a 
cross-chain module is deployed to the testing network, which would require a 
manual update of the corresponding address.

=== Deploy contracts

To deploy the L1 BTCDepositorWormhole contract on the given network, please run:
```
yarn deploy --network <network>
```

Supported networks:
- `hardhat` - for local development
- `sepolia` - Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- `mainnet` - Ethereum mainnet

This module deploys the BTCDepositorWormhole contract on L1 (Ethereum) that enables
tBTC bridging to Sui. The Sui-side contracts (Move modules) are deployed separately
and their addresses are stored under `external/<network>` dir.

If contracts haven't been built yet or changes occurred, `deploy` task will build
the contracts before running the deployment script. This command produces
an `export.json` file containing contract deployment info. Note that for the
chains other than `hardhat` the following environment variables are needed:

- `L1_CHAIN_API_URL` - URL to access Ethereum blockchain services, e.g. `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY`
- `L1_ACCOUNTS_PRIVATE_KEYS` - Private keys for the deployer `<0xDeployerPrivKey>`
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` - Etherscan API key for contract verification

=== Sui Move Contracts

The Sui-side contracts are implemented as Move modules and include:

- `WormholeGateway` - Processes Wormhole messages and mints/burns tBTC
- `tBTC` - The tBTC token implementation on Sui
- `BitcoinDepositor` - Handles deposit initialization and processing

These contracts are deployed separately using the Sui CLI and their addresses are
configured in the `external/suiTestnet/` and `external/sui/` directories.

Current deployment status:
- **Testnet**: ✅ Deployed
- **Mainnet**: ⏳ Not yet deployed

=== Configuration

The BTCDepositorWormhole contract requires the following configuration:

1. **Sui Gateway Address**: The address of the WormholeGateway on Sui
2. **Wormhole Chain ID**: 21 for Sui (both mainnet and testnet)
3. **Wormhole Core & Token Bridge**: Standard Wormhole infrastructure addresses

These are configured during deployment and can be found in the deployment artifacts.
