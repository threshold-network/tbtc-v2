/**
 * Programmable contract mock, replacing `@defi-wonderland/smock`.
 *
 * smock configured its fakes by mutating in-process JavaScript state inside
 * Hardhat's EVM, which is why its API was synchronous — and also why it broke
 * on Hardhat >= 2.20 and is archived upstream with no forward path. This
 * replacement drives an ordinary deployed contract (`MockContract.sol`)
 * over the public provider API, so it depends on nothing Hardhat can change
 * underneath it.
 *
 * The consequence is that configuration is a transaction, so every setup and
 * inspection call here returns a promise and must be awaited. That is the one
 * behavioural difference from smock and the reason the migration touches call
 * sites at all.
 *
 * A transaction also mines a block, and Hardhat advances the clock a second
 * per block, where smock advanced it not at all. Suites that assert on a
 * boundary cannot absorb that: WalletProposalValidator stubs a 7200 second
 * delay, advances time by exactly 7200 and requires
 * `block.timestamp > requestedAt + minAge` to be false — any drift inverts it.
 * So every write below pins the next block's timestamp to the current one,
 * which needs `allowBlocksWithSameTimestamp` in hardhat.config.ts and is why
 * this package is on hardhat >= 2.19.
 *
 * Semantics follow Foundry's `vm.mockCall` deliberately: an exact-calldata
 * entry wins over a selector-wide default, and an unconfigured function
 * returns the zero value of its return type, matching smock.
 *
 * That last part is not free. Solidity compares returndatasize against the
 * size its ABI expects and reverts on a short answer, so a mock cannot answer
 * an unconfigured function with empty data — it has to return a correctly
 * encoded zero. Only this helper knows the mocked ABI, so it computes those
 * encodings up front and installs them in the mock as a base layer that
 * `reset` does not disturb.
 */

/**
 * Runs a configuration transaction without advancing the chain clock.
 *
 * `allowBlocksWithSameTimestamp` only *permits* a block to reuse the previous

 * the machine happens to be.
