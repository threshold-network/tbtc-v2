# Rebate Deployment Instructions for All Actors

## Overview

The rebate functionality requires coordination between three actors:

1. **Deployer** - Deploys contracts and prepares transactions
2. **ProxyAdmin Owner** - Upgrades Bridge proxy
3. **Governance** - Sets RebateStaking in Bridge

---

## Actor 1: Deployer

### Prerequisites:

- Access to deployment wallet with ETH
- Environment variables set:
  ```bash
  export CHAIN_API_URL="your_rpc_url"
  export ACCOUNTS_PRIVATE_KEYS="your_private_key"
  ```

### Steps:

1. **Deploy all contracts:**

   ```bash
   cd solidity
   yarn deploy --tags DeployRebateAndPrepareTxs --network mainnet
   ```

2. **Save the output** - It contains:

   - Deployed contract addresses
   - Transaction data for other actors
   - JSON file location with all deployment info

3. **Share with other actors:**
   - Send ProxyAdmin section to ProxyAdmin owner
   - Send Governance section to Governance team
   - Keep JSON file for reference
